 ====ABSTRACT=======

There is a need for effective help to various Non-Profit Organizations that work tirelessly to help the needy in various ways possible. One such use case is effective re-distribution of surplus foods various places like restaurants, cafes etc. produce. This study aims to address this by analyzing modern tools and ICT to build a system that simplifies search for NGOs looking for perfect volunteers to procure food/grains from. Ignoring the delivery logistics, this application will be a website which is integrated with a Random Forest Classifier model that learns to categorize restaurants based on Ratings, Distance from the user and Quantity of food they offer. This is achieved via training by a synthetic dataset with bias. The model's output is coupled with the website to display results. This study also serves as a starting point from where a more complex system can be built.
